# Server Usage Log

This documentation will cover 2 versions of the Server Usage Log, both designed to achieve a different purpose and cater to specific use cases. By providing an overview of each version, we aim to equip users with a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and functionalities offered by the different iterations of the Usage Log.

All the System Usage Logs are tools designed to capture and record key information about the CPU usage and RAM Memory usage of remote servers. It serves as a valuable resource for administrators to understand why a server might have crashed and what applications led to the crash.

Another use case would be to understand if a server is coming a little too close to the max memory usage requirement. It can give you a good indicator of when to upgrade a server if the usage is being logged close to maximum capacity.
